## Option 6: Hybrid Approach (Static + Dynamic)

If you want to keep GitHub Pages for static content but add dynamic functionality:

### Setup:

4. **Use the static version** as a fallback when the dynamic server is down

### Benefits:
- ✅ Always have a working version (static)
- ✅ Dynamic functionality when available
- ✅ No downtime
- ✅ SEO benefits from static content

## Recommended Approach

**For your use case, I recommend Option 1 (Render.com)** because:

1. **Free tier** is generous
2. **Automatic deployments** from GitHub
3. **Full dynamic functionality** preserved
4. **Easy setup** and maintenance
5. **Good performance** for dashboards

## Migration Steps

1. **Choose your hosting platform** (Render recommended)
2. **Follow the setup steps** above
3. **Test the deployment** thoroughly
4. **Update your documentation** with the new URL
5. **Consider keeping the static version** as a backup

## Environment Variables

If you need to configure environment variables, add them in your hosting platform's dashboard:

- `DEBUG=False` (for production)
- Any API keys or configuration values

## Monitoring

Most platforms provide built-in monitoring. For additional monitoring, consider:

- **Uptime monitoring**: UptimeRobot (free)
- **Error tracking**: Sentry (free tier available)
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics
