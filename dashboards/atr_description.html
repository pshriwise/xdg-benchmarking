The Advanced Test Reactor (ATR), located at Idaho National Laboratory (INL), is a premier pressurized water test reactor designed for nuclear fuel and materials testing. Its distinctive "Four Leaf Clover" core configuration allows for multiple high-intensity neutron flux traps, enabling simultaneous experimentation under varied conditions. The ATR operates at a maximum thermal power of 250 megawatts and is equipped with a beryllium reflector to concentrate neutrons on test specimens. This unique design facilitates the study of radiation effects on materials, supporting advancements in nuclear reactor technologies and contributing to national defense programs.
