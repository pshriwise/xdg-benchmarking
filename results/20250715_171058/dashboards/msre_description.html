The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) was a test reactor operated at Oak
Ridge National Laboratory in the 1960s, designed to explore the feasibility of
molten salt fuel and graphite moderation in a thermal-spectrum reactor. It used
a liquid fluoride fuel mixture of U235 and later U233, circulating
through a graphite core for moderation. The CAD model of the MSRE described in
the article is a detailed 3D geometric representation developed by Copenhagen
Atomics. It includes high-fidelity modeling of reactor components such as the
graphite moderator, salt circuits, and structural features, aiming to capture
the reactorâ€™s physical layout with engineering-level precision. The model is
used to enable advanced neutronics and thermal-hydraulics simulations with
modern particle transport tools.
